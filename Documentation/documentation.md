# My websites colour scheme 
## Design 1
+ The colour scheme of the first design, ive gone for a pastel colour design as it complements the entire logo and i think it will complement the phones too as most phone companys allow you to get your phone in many different colours including the colours our scheme highlights such as blues and reds
+ The pastel pallet isn't too distracting and isn't too boring it the perfect as there quite soft colours

+ .colour-primary-1 {colour:687A91} Header and footer colour
+ .colour-primary-2 {colour:836994} Secondary colour

## Design 2
+ The colour scheme of the second design is a basic colours as the website is aimed at adults as children wont be buying these them selfs as the age that is the most of the percent of people to buy them is 30-50yr old women so i want it to look as professional as possible so they will be able to trust and understand the website.
+ The colours are quite basic as then it isnt too distracting from the product, as well for older generation they aren't all up to date with the technology of today so the less complex the website is the easier it will be to understand where everthing is.

# Fonts
## Design 1: 
## Main fonts of the website
+ For the website i will use the Comfortaa font this is because it is a nice and simple font with not much change compaired to the normal font so it wont be as distracting, Comfortaa is also just quite an nice and smooth font to read in.     
+ The font will come from google fonts: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa,
The weight is gunna be: Medium 500.
+ My website will not all one font my second font of choice is Catamaran this is because i feel like it is a good contrast to my previous font, This will be used for all of the titiles and navigation bar. 
+ This font will come from google fonts: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Catamaran, The weight of the font is gunna be: Extra-light 200. 
## How i would use each font
I would use Catamaran for all the description and all the information as it is a good contrast to the other font as its quite sharp compaired to the smoothness of the Comfortaa and i would use the Comfortaa as titles and on the navigation bar as Comfortaa is designed for bigger text and it is quite a smooth and clean font.
## Design 2:
## Main fonts of the website 
+ For the website i will use the Josefin Sans font this is because it has quite a nice look to it and it is quite an unique font that i feel is under apprecated, it also goes really well with the layout and colours of this website.
+ The font will come from google fonts: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans, The weight of the font will be: Extra-light 200.
+ For the website i will also use the font Mukta it is quite a smooth look and slick looking font comparded to the hard edges of the Josefin Sans it is a nice contrast as i would use this font for the titles and navigation bar and then use the Josefin Sans font for the use of information and descriptions of them.  

# Tests

+ The test i will be doing will consist of checking that all my links lead somewhere and that the main features of the website will work as intended such as:
The Carasoul works and you can switch between images
The Images of the phone all load and can be seen and positioned properly
The table of specs of the items

# Navigation

+ if you are able to travel there it will have an "Y"

# Reviews
## Aiden : 
The colour choice is nice, the purple with the contrast of white is nice with it being accented around.

The font colour and choice could be improved, I'd recommend the colour white would fit and a different font to look better.

The phone website looks good, at the time of writing this - there is no video. The specs are great, wide variety to look at and compare others with. The buy button is missing too. Why may i not purchase thy product.

## Ash :
it looks very nice because you have good boxes with loads of improtant information
i like the name
the colour purple on the website makes it look depressing
you might need to work on the links a bit
the text colour looks nice
theres a lot of detail in the text boxes, a bit to much for my brain to handle
very nice selection of phones,not a single andriod hmm
